## Additional Comments and Improvements

### **1. Security Enhancements**
- **Use JWT for Authentication:** Instead of a simple authToken, implement JWT to improve security and prevent token forgery.
- **Rate Limiting:** Introduce a rate-limiting mechanism (e.g., using Redis) to prevent API abuse.
- **HMAC Signature Validation:** Use HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to verify the integrity of incoming API requests.
- **IP & Device Tracking:** Monitor requests to detect and prevent potential fraudulent score updates.

### **2. Performance Optimizations**
- **Caching with Redis:** Store the top 10 leaderboard in Redis to avoid frequent database queries and improve response time.
- **Batch Processing for Updates:** Instead of updating the database on every API call, consider batching updates in intervals to reduce database load.
- **Indexing Database Columns:** Ensure the `score` column is indexed for fast retrieval of the leaderboard.

### **3. Real-time Updates**
- **WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE):** Implement WebSockets or SSE to push real-time updates to connected clients.
- **Polling as a Fallback:** If WebSockets are not feasible, implement a polling mechanism with reasonable intervals.

### **4. Data Integrity & Validation**
- **Sanitize Inputs:** Ensure that user-provided data is sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.
- **Score Validation Rules:** Define rules such as maximum score increment per action to prevent unnatural score jumps.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain logs of score changes to track anomalies and enable rollbacks if needed.

### **5. Scalability Considerations**
- **Microservices Architecture:** Consider breaking the scoreboard service into a separate microservice for better scalability.
- **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer to distribute traffic efficiently among multiple API servers.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale out database read replicas for handling high leaderboard queries.

### **6. Additional Features for Future Enhancements**
- **User Ranking System:** Introduce ranking tiers (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) based on score thresholds.
- **Historical Score Tracking:** Maintain historical scores to allow users to track their progress over time.
- **Event-Based Score Boosts:** Implement time-based or event-based score multipliers for engagement.

These improvements will enhance security, performance, and scalability of the leaderboard API system.
